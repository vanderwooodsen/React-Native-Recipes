# Overview
"Tasty List" was my hackathon project at The Grace Hopper Academy. I wanted to try using React Native and used Expo for my setup. It is a recipe search tool using TheMealDB API with the ability to store recipes marked as favorite. I used React Native Paper for the UI, React Navigation for page transitions and Redux to manage the state.
